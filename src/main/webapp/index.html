<!--
Explain the following:
 How does the server know that users are logged-in for subsequent calls to a protected page after we
have logged-in (why is it not necessary to retype the username/password)

ANSWER: because a cookie is generated with an session ID, the session on the server will keep the identification
as long as the session is alive and the cookie remains in the browser.

 For subsequent calls to a protected resource, where is the information stored that tells we are already
logged in (on the Server on in the Client)?

ANSWER: The authorization happens on the server, it identifies the user from the cookie which are stored on the client.

 This question relates to the question above. Is Form Based Authentication stateful or stateless (seen
from the servers point of view)?

ANSWER: stateful - because there is placed a cookie that keeps track of the previous transaction.
